4. After selecting the engine, scroll down to the bottom of the page.
5. Confirm the deletion of all files from your server and the creation of a backup. If necessary, you can exclude specific files and folders from formatting to prevent them from being deleted. **We recommend using this option only if you have important data on the server, such as progress stored in the `world` folder.**
