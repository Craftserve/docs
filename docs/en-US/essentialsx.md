This plugin is divided into different modules. Below is a list of them along with their descriptions.

### EssentialsX
The main module that handles most of the commands, economy, and trading via signs. It is a core module, so no add-ons will work without it.

### EssentialsChat
Handles text formatting in chat and allows easier management of things like prefixes and suffixes.

### EssentialsXSpawn
Handles spawn-related commands such as:
* /setspawn
* /spawn

### EssentialsAntiBuild
Manages permissions for who can build/destroy certain blocks. However, we recommend using [WorldEdit](https://dev.bukkit.org/projects/worldedit) along with [WorldGuard](https://dev.bukkit.org/projects/worldguard).

### EssentialsProtect
Handles additional world rules. With this plugin, you can set things like what a creeper can destroy or what mobs are allowed to spawn in the world.

### EssentialsXMPP
Handles the [XMPP](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Extensible_Messaging_and_Presence_Protocol) text communication protocol.

### EssentialsGeoIP
Allows you to check from where a particular player is logging in.

### Installation
