This plugin is divided into various modules. Below is a list of these modules along with their descriptions.

### EssentialsX
The main module that handles most commands, economy, and trading via signs. It is the core module, so no addon will work without it.

### EssentialsChat
Handles text formatting on chat, making it easier to manage things like prefixes and suffixes.

### EssentialsXSpawn
Handles spawn-related commands such as:
* /setspawn
* /spawn

### EssentialsAntiBuild
Handles permissions for who can build/destroy certain blocks. However, it is recommended to use [WorldEdit](https://dev.bukkit.org/projects/worldedit) along with [WorldGuard](https://dev.bukkit.org/projects/worldguard).

### EssentialsProtect
Handles additional world rules. With this plugin, you can set, for example, what destroys creepers or which mobs can spawn in the world.

### EssentialsXMPP
Handles the [XMPP](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Extensible_Messaging_and_Presence_Protocol) text communication protocol.

### EssentialsGeoIP
Allows you to check where a player is logging in from.
